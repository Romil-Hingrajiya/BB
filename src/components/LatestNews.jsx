    description:
      "India's steel sector is expanding rapidly, aiming to increase production capacity from 200 million to 300 million metric tons annually by 2030. This growth necessitates a higher demand for iron ore. Although India is the fourth-largest iron ore producer, its 2024â€“2025 output of 289 million tons falls short of the projected requirement of approximately 460 million tons.
